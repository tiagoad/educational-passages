Educational Passages Tracker
============================

This is a tracker for the Educational Passages project based on Leaflet.

It is composed of two parts - a go program that processes the raw `.dat` files provided by NOAA, joining together data from multiple GPS transmitters, and calculating the dates for each point, and a web application that processes and displays the data.

It is licensed under the very permissive MIT license.
